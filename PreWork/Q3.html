  <h1>Strength Finder</h1>
  <i>One tool we'll be using for your professional development at Turing is the Clifton
    StrengthsFinder assessment. Unlike other assessments, one of the hallmarks of StrengthsFinder
     is that it focuses solely on what you're already doing well in order to understand how to
     capitalize on those strengths.
  </i>
  <p>
    You'll take this assessment in the first week of Module One, but this activity invites you to begin
    building an understanding of how learning about and developing your strengths applies to your success
    in your new career. Read through the following three articles and write a reflection using the questions listed below:

  <ol>
    <li><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashoka/2014/04/15/how-to-hire-like-google-and-facebook-evaluating-candidates-beyond-their-technical-ability/#74d0831d13bf">How to Hire like Google</a><br></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Evidence indicates that [the] talent gap is not due to the absence of technical skills, as one might expect, but rather to the absence of “soft skills,” or what we’ll call 21st century skills, in prospective candidates. These primarily refer to interpersonal and general analytic abilities like teamwork, empathy, leadership, negotiation, adaptability, and problem solving.</li>
    <li>Gallup’s StrengthsFinder 2.0 is a tool that helps individuals understand and describe their own talents, and is commonly used by managers to understand and capitalize on the strengths of those they hire. More importantly, it is methodologically sound, and its reliability and validity are backed up by clear evidence.</li>
    <li>Instead of seeking general traits and preferences, selection tools are tailored to a particular job in a particular organization, and are statistically calibrated to provide reliable predictive results (i.e., candidates who score highly on these tests also tend to perform well after they’re hired). </li>
    <li><a href="https://www.pairin.com/">Pairin, Inc.</a> is another organization that seeks to combine the personality test approach with specialized testing (for specific jobs, values, culture, etc.) as part of a pre-employment selection system.</li>
    <li>As another example of innovation, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/opinion/sunday/friedman-how-to-get-a-job-at-google.html?_r=0">Google also uses behavioral interviews</a>, but structures them in a way that allows HR to perform analytics and prove that certain responses reliably predict employee performance.</li>
    <li>The world only cares about — and pays off on — what you can do with what you know (and it doesn’t care how you learned it). And in an age when innovation is increasingly a group endeavor, it also cares about a lot of soft skills — leadership, humility, collaboration, adaptability and loving to learn and re-learn. This will be true no matter where you go to work.</li>

    <ol>
      <li>Technical Ability</li>
      <li>General Cognitive Ability, or the ability to process on the fly</li>
      <li>Leadership, do you step up and can you relinquish power</li>
      <li>Humility to learn from mistakes and Ownership, problem solving desire</li>
    </ol>
