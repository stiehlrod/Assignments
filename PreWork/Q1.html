      <h2>29 Behaviors That Will Make You an Unstoppable Programmer</h2>
        <h3>* Pick out 3 behaviors that resonate with you in the list and describe why they resonate with you in a reflection (4-6 sentences).</h3>

      <ol>
      <li>Become a power user of your development tools. <br>
        <p>
        This resonates with me because in the past I have learned the tools I use on the go.
        This method can be very disruptive to a project if you come across something you don’t
        know how to do and have to stop developing in order to learn how the tool works. I will
        start with Atom.io and then move onto Vim. In addition, I will be learning the command
        line prompts that interact with Github.

      </li><br>

      <li>Act like a leader, not a boss. <br><p>
        "Leaders are the people who other people follow.” I want to inspire others to be their best
        and I will need to do this by being my best, being an expert in specific areas and having
        confidence to help others when they struggle and stating the answer when I know it. In the
        past, I have had a tendency to say things like “I think” instead of stating what I know as a fact.
      </p></li>
      <li>
        <p>Acknowledge that micro-decisions matter. Making your code easy to understand is super important
          and small decisions like naming your variables matters and I need to develop a pattern of naming
          so I don’t even need to think about it, by always naming  the same way. I like camel case, specific
          and short names, like NumReps. I do not know what cache invalidation means, so I am going to look
          that up, same with “off by one errors”.
