Read through 29 Behaviors That Will Make You an Unstoppable Programmer
* Approximate reading time: 20 minutes
* Pick out 3 behaviors that resonate with you in the list and describe why they resonate with you in a reflection (4-6 sentences).

1. Become a power user of your development tools. This resonates with me because in the past I have learned the tools I use on the go or as i have used them. This method can be very disruptive to a project if you come across something you don’t know how to do and have to stop developing in order to learn how the tool works. I will start with Atom.io and then move onto Vim. Videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF02EIGI7P8, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyG20hhON6E&index=2&list=PLYzJdSdNWNqwNWlxz7bvu-lOYR0CFWQ4I

2. Act like a leader, not a boss. "Leaders are the people who other people follow.” I want to inspire others to be their best and I will need to do this by being my best, being an expert in specific areas and having confidence to help others when they struggle and stating the answer when I know it. In the past, I have had a tendency to say things like “I think” instead of stating what I know as a fact.

3. Acknowledge that micro-decisions matter. Making your code easy to understand is super important and small decisions like naming your variables matters and I need to develop a pattern of naming so I don’t even need to think about it, by always naming  the same way. I like camel case, specific and short names, like NumReps. I do not know what cache invalidation means, so I am going to look that up, same with “off by one errors”. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_invalidation, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-by-one_error, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1188587/cache-invalidation-is-there-a-general-solution
