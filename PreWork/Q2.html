  <h1>Organization</h1>
<i>
  Organization is paramount to success both at Turing and in a career as a programmer.
  There are many ways to stay organized, but in this activity, you'll explore one system in particular
  -- utilizing a strong checklist. Read through and/or listen to this interview with Atul Gawande
  (author of the Checklist Manifesto). It includes an excerpt from his book, which is optional reading.

<h3>
  Approximate reading time (including the excerpt from the book, which is optional): 22 minutes
  After reading, consider the idea of checklists. Write a reflection (4-6 sentences) on the benefits of a checklist and how an organizational system such as a checklist might help you first as a student and later as a full-time developer.
</h3>
<p>
  Checklists can help me learn by not forgetting important steps and forming appropriate patterns
  and as a developer they can help to remind me, even when I think I am experienced, all the steps
  no matter how insignificant they may seem, are in fact important. Sometimes, when faced with a
  difficult problem, a checklist can be a familiar friend reassuring us that there is hope within a
  method, there is a place to start and often getting started is the most difficult piece to solving
  a problem.
